# ðŸ’¥ Gst-Crashy [WIP]

--- Work in progress ---

Gst plugin and tutorials for causing planned leaks and crashes.

You want to know how to debug problems before they surface. This repository's
goal is two-fold:

- provide a few elements to test debug and crash reporting infrastructure and tooling.
- provide a few tutorials and best practices on debugging gstreamer applications.

The plugin contains two filter elements based on `GstBaseTransform`:

- `leaky`: provides several mechanisms of leaking memory.
- `faulty`: provides a few ways of crashing a pipeline.
